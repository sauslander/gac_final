Raw data

The raw data for this assignment originated from:
      Website otulining scope of the experiement - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
      Zip file containing data from the site - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Process

From the zip file above, a folder was created in my working directory called Get_Clean_project that conatins all files needed to 
complete the assignment.

Below are the files that were uploaded for this assignment from Get_Clean_project folder:
      subject_test.txt
      subject_train.txt
      x_train.txt
      y_train.txt
      x_test.txt
      y_test.txt
      activity_labels.txt
      features.txt
      
      
Manipulation:
      1) After uploading all the txt files mentioned above except features.txt, labels were set as subject_id (subject txt files),
      activity_id (y txt files), and activity (activity txt files).
      2) Merged data sets using dplyr package by category of test vs train group.
      3) Merged rows of the test and train data sets to one (called gac_merged_activity).
      4) Read in the features data set and applied the names in that txt file to gac_merged_activity.
      5) Created a new data set (gac_merged_final) by grouping gac_merged_activity by specified variables in the assignment
      instructions.
      6) Tidy data using the tidyr package
      7) Created final data set (gac_final_tidy) by averaging the column of the specified variables from the assignment information.
      
*** Each step above was checked by using dim(), head(), tail(), and unique() functions for dataframes and columns of these dataframes.

Final Results

Result is a final tidy data set in a txt file: gac_tidy_sa.txt

Final variables in set include:
user_id - is the number specified for each subject
activity - is the activity performed by the subjects (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs
measures - are the mean and standard deviaton measures that were calculated for each subject performing the activities above
values - are the average values recorded for each measure
